              <p>Hi! I'm Guillermo Croppi.</p>
              <p>Passionate about democracy, technology, and their intersection in shaping the future of governance. With a background in Systems Engineering from the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional de Santa Fe, I'm a Fullstack Web Developer (github.com/guillecro) and a fervent advocate for digital democracy in the 21st century.</p>
              <p>Values such as kindness, respect, teamwork, creativity, and innovation are at the core of my beliefs, guiding both my professional endeavors and personal interactions. I thrive in dynamic environments, readily adapting to diverse teams and challenges. I firmly believe in the profound impact of the work environment on individuals and advocate for a strong humanistic foundation in every project, fostering collaboration and inclusivity among professionals and users alike.</p>
                <p>I am deeply committed to continuous learning and skill development, always eager to both acquire new knowledge and share it with others. As an educator, I've spent six years as Professor and Coordinator of Introductory Physics Courses at the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional de Santa Fe. Additionally, as the creator of Virtuagora, a web platform for citizen participation (<a href="https://github.com/virtuagora">github.com/virtuagora</a>), I've collaborated with the Province of Santa Fe on various projects, including participative budgeting initiatives and digital consultations for legislative reforms.</p>
                <p>Currently, I serve as the Tech Lead at <a href="https://democraciaenred.org" target="_blank">"Democracia en Red"</a>, an NGO dedicated to empowering civil and political projects through citizen engagement and digital technology. I also used to hold the position of Head of Systems and Technologies at <a href="https://lyris.com.ar" target="_blank">Lyris IT</a>, a consultancy specializing in digital administration and electronic signatures.</p>
              <p>I am honored to have received recognition from the Senate and Vice Governorship of the Province of Santa Fe, as well as winning the First Prize in the Digital Municipalities Innovation Contest 2015 (SF-Ar). My journey also includes participation in events like INNOVAR 2015 (Tecnopolis-CABA-Ar).</p>
              <p>Committed to driving positive change through technology, I continuously strive to expand my professional portfolio with impactful projects and contributions to both the community and my workplace. My goal is not to be better than others but to collaborate and uplift alongside them.</p>
